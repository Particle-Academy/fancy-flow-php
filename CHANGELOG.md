# Changelog

Notable changes to `particle-academy/fancy-flow-php`.

**BREAKING** marks anything that can stop working on upgrade. This package is
pre-1.0, so breaking changes land in MINOR releases — read those entries before
upgrading.

## 0.6.0

### BREAKING — the PHP floor is now 8.3

`require.php` moves from `^8.2` to `^8.3`. Composer will refuse to install this
release on PHP 8.2.

**What to do:** upgrade to PHP 8.3 or later, or pin to `^0.5` and stay there.

**Why:** the `laravel/ai` adapter shipped in 0.5.0 requires PHP 8.3, so with an
8.2 floor it could not sit in `require-dev` at all. Its tests were therefore
skipped everywhere except one bespoke CI job — thin coverage for one of the two
adapters we ship specifically so nobody has to hand-roll an LLM client. Raising
the floor puts it under test in the normal matrix and on every contributor's
machine. PHP 8.2's active support ended in December 2024.

### Changed

- CI matrix is now 8.3 + 8.4, and the separate `laravel/ai` job is gone —
  the matrix covers it.
- `laravel/ai` joins `prism-php/prism` in `require-dev`. Neither is a runtime
  dependency; `require` remains `{"php": "^8.3"}`.

## 0.5.0

### BREAKING — builtin kind ids are namespaced

Canonical kind ids move from bare names to `@particle-academy/<name>` —
`switch_case` becomes `@particle-academy/switch_case`.

**What to do:** most likely nothing. Every bare name is registered as an alias,
so saved documents keep opening, `NodeKindRegistry::get('switch_case')` keeps
resolving, and executors bound under bare names keep matching. Export writes the
canonical id, so graphs converge as they are re-saved.

You only need to act if you compared a kind id with `===` against a bare
string, or used one as an array key expecting the exact literal back.

**Why now:** `kind` is persisted inside every saved document. The moment two
packages both ship a node called `llm_branch`, stored graphs are ambiguous and
there is no migration path, because the ambiguous string is already written into
the document. This is cheap today and impossible later.

### BREAKING — `llm_branch` is renamed to `llm_router`

Canonical id `@particle-academy/llm_router`, label "LLM Router".

**What to do:** nothing required. `llm_branch`, `@fancy/llm_branch` and
`llm_router` all resolve, and config keys are unchanged (`routes[].port`,
`fallback`, `provider`, `model`, `system`, `prompt`).

**Why:** the palette said "Router", the id said "branch", and the config key is
`routes` — three vocabularies for one node. The node picks one of N named
routes; it is not a two-way branch.

### Added

- **Capability seam** — `LlmClient` and `WorkflowResolver`. Core declares the
  contract; the host supplies the implementation. Register via a static setter
  (framework-free) or the Laravel container.
- **Two shipped LLM adapters** — Prism and `laravel/ai`. Exactly one installed
  wires itself with no configuration; both installed requires
  `fancy-flow.llm.driver`; neither aborts naming what to install. A client you
  register yourself always wins.
- **`llm_router` executor** — a shuttle, not an engine: it carries the declared
  routes out to the host's client and the choice back. A port the model invents
  never routes (it goes to `fallback`, else the first declared route, always
  with a warning), and the reason travels with the value as
  `{route, reason, input}`.
- **`subflow`** — run another workflow, with `output` / `stream` / `both` modes,
  child progress surfaced as tagged log lines against the subflow node, and a
  depth guard that names the offending reference instead of overflowing the
  stack.

### Fixed

- Wiring capabilities in `boot()` eagerly resolved the workflow resolver, which
  dragged the `NodeKindRegistry` singleton into existence before
  config-declared kinds were read. Now resolved lazily through container
  proxies.

## 0.4.2

### Fixed — cross-runtime port parity

`activatedPorts` now falls back to the node KIND's declared ports before
falling back to a lone `out`.

fancy-flow 0.9.0 made the TS runtime resolve ports through the kind, including
config-driven kinds. This runtime read only the node's own ports. Before that
change both fell back to `out` and agreed; afterwards the same `WorkflowSchema`
could route differently on Node and PHP.

**Scope, corrected:** only kinds that rely on DECLARED ports to fan out were
affected. An executor returning an explicit port via `Port::only(...)` (or a
`__port` / `branch` key) short-circuits before the fallback and was never
affected. An earlier advisory implied branch edges would stop firing generally;
that was too broad.

Only **non-empty** kind ports are adopted — a terminal kind declares an empty
list, and consuming that literally would publish zero ports where the historical
fallback published `out`.

---

## 0.4.1

### Added — `WorkflowSettled`

Dispatched on every exit path of a durable run — completed, awaiting_approval,
awaiting_input, errored — exactly one per in-process attempt, carrying the
outcome plus `isTerminal()` / `isAwaitingHuman()`.

`WorkflowStarted` always fired, but only success dispatched a terminal event, so
anything a host bound for a run's duration (an ambient run context, a listener,
a log scope) was never torn down when a run paused, failed, or threw — and
leaked onto the queue worker.

**Bind teardown to `WorkflowSettled`**; `WorkflowFinished` / `WorkflowFailed`
remain for reporting. `failed()` now dispatches `WorkflowFailed` too — terminal
failure after retries was previously written to the database and announced to
nobody.
